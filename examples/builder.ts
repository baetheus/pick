/**
 * This example is a work in progress. As I refine the builder portion of the
 * pick library this example should get simpler. The basic idea of a Site is
 * that you point it at a directory, give it a few Builders, which turn files in
 * the directory into StaticRoutes, ClientRoutes, or ServerRoutes, and end up
 * with an api, a spa, and static assets colocated in as sensible a fashion as
 * you see fit.
 *
 * My goal is to keep the actual SiteBuilder and Builder types generic enough
 * that they can be run on any platform (ie. Deno, Bun, or Nodejs).
